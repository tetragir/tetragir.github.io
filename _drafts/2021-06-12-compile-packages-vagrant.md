title: Updating the Ports tree on FreeBSD using Vagrant

I maintain a couple of packagaes in the FreeBSD ports tree, but I never had a good way to maintain them. I used to have a Jail where all the changes would happen, then the build, then the tests, but that also means that that jail will change over time. I was looking for a solution that would help me create an environment that is reproducible and easy to maintain.
