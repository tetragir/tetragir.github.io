I have decided to create a blog. My main goal is to write articles and guides about various topics, like Cisco Networking, FreeBSD and Linux. This blog is powered by *jekyll*, and is completly javascript and flash free. There are no cookies, and no Analytics either. Just the pure content. I use the most minimalistic theme possible, focusing of the contents of the posts. This blog is also easily readable with a command line browser too, like lynx.
